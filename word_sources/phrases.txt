Tu sahi hai yaar – You’re cool, bro
Bhai kya scene hai? – What’s the situation, bro?
Sahi pakde hain! – You got that right!
Yeh toh over ho gaya – That was too much
Chill maar yaar – Just relax
Samajh gaya na? – Got it, right?
Bakwaas band kar – Stop the nonsense
Kaun karta hai aise? – Who even does that?
Zyada ud mat – Don’t act too smart
Kamaal kar diya yaar – You nailed it, bro
Arey wah! – Oh wow!
Arey yeh toh kamaal ho gaya – This is amazing
Bhai, tu toh legend nikla – Bro, you're a legend
Bas yahi bacha tha – Just what we needed (sarcastic)
Itna bhi kya sochna? – What’s there to think so much?
Jyada mat soch – Don’t overthink
Oye hoye, kya baat hai! – Wow, that’s awesome!
Kya timing hai teri – Your timing is epic
Tu kabhi nahi sudhrega – You’ll never change
Maar diya bhai tune! – You killed it, bro!
Drama band kar – Stop the drama
Mazaa aa gaya – That was fun
Scene ban gaya – The plan worked out
Sab setting hai – Everything’s arranged
Tu toh player nikla – You're a real player
Mood kharab kar diya – You ruined the mood
Scene tight hai – Things are serious now
Tu chhupa rustam hai – You're secretly awesome
Timepass mat kar – Don’t waste time
Tera toh level alag hi hai – You’re on another level
